# Display website contents on a Inkplate e-paper display

Code for my DIY project that displays my sons school timetable on an Inkplate e-paper display. Find a full description of the project in [this blog post](https://mfasold.net/blog/displaying-website-content-on-an-e-ink-display/).

Note: this code is not fully functional as-is. You need to replace several variables, e.g. WiFI and login passwords, URL endpoints, and adapt to your website. No support at all! :)
